# iFINITY AgentZ Connection

The iMIS plugin authenticates through the iFINITY AgentZ desktop app. There is no
manual credential entry in Claude, Cowork, or Claude Code.

The AgentZ desktop app is downloaded from the iFINITY licensing download page:

```text
https://ifinityagentz.co.uk/download
```

That page is gated by the organisation auth code or a magic-link email unlock,
and also exposes the current Claude Cowork plugin ZIP.

## Check Connection

Call `imis_connection_status`.

If connected, report:
- iMIS instance URL
- OAuth/token state
- whether browser automation is available through AgentZ bridge

## If Not Connected

Guide the user through AgentZ path:

1. If AgentZ is not installed, download it from `https://ifinityagentz.co.uk/download`.
2. Open iFINITY AgentZ on the local machine.
3. Sign in with the iFINITY licence magic link.
4. Save iMIS credentials in Settings > iMIS Account.
5. For org admins, use Settings > API Connection to create or repair the iMIS Client Application.
6. Keep AgentZ running while using Claude Code or Cowork.

Once AgentZ connects, it pushes the iMIS instance URL and OAuth token to the plugin over the localhost WebSocket bridge.

## Verify

After the user has AgentZ running, call `imis_connection_status` again. If connected, run a low-risk read such as:

```text
imis_find_member search="test"
```

Use a small limit and avoid write operations until the connection and target iMIS instance are confirmed.
