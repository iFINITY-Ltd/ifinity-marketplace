# iMIS System Configuration

Configure and administer iMIS system features — security, billing, pricing, commerce, process automation, forms, data migration, and integrations.

**Documentation resource**: Use the `imis-docs` connector to search official iMIS help articles (help.imis.com) for detailed configuration steps, settings options, and UI workflows. Many system configuration tasks require the iMIS admin UI — the docs provide the exact steps.

---

## Security & Access Configuration

### System Roles
Built-in roles with specific system-level permissions:
- **SysAdmin**: Full system access — use sparingly
- **CompanyAdministrator**: Organisational admin — manages users and settings
- **OnBehalfOf**: Proxy access — act as another user
- **RemoteService**: API/integration service accounts
- **Everyone**: Default role for all authenticated users

### Security Groups
Module-specific access control. Common groups:
- **CampaignAdmin / CampaignMgr / CampaignUser**: Fundraising campaign access tiers
- **CertificationAdmin / CertificationMgr / CertificationUser**: Certification program access
- **EventUser**: Event management access
- **FRUser**: Fundraising/giving access
- **OpportunityAdmin / OpportunityCreator / OpportunityMgr**: Sales opportunity access

### Managing User Credentials
Create login credentials:
```
imis_user_security action="create" partyId={id} username={email} password={temp}
```

Verify credentials work:
```
imis_check_login username={email} password={password}
```

Check existing security:
```
imis_user_security action="get" partyId={id}
```

**API Limitation**: No update endpoint — to change credentials, delete and recreate:
```
imis_user_security action="delete" partyId={id}
imis_user_security action="create" partyId={id} username={newEmail} password={newPwd}
```

### Access Configuration Guidance
- **Role hierarchy**: Assign minimum necessary roles — start restrictive, add as needed
- **Module authorisation**: Each iMIS module has its own access level (None, Read, Full)
- **Lockout policies**: Configure via iMIS Settings > Security — failed attempts, lockout duration
- **Password policies**: Minimum length, complexity, expiry — configured in iMIS admin
- **IP restrictions**: Can restrict staff site access by IP range

## Billing Cycle Configuration

### Billing Types

#### Dues Billing (Membership)
Generates renewal invoices for membership subscriptions:
- **Annual billing**: All members billed at same time (e.g., January 1)
- **Anniversary billing**: Each member billed on their join anniversary date
- **Customer type selection**: Bill specific member types or all
- **Chapter/section inclusion**: Include chapter and section dues on same invoice
- **Prorating**: New members joining mid-cycle can be prorated

#### Non-Dues Billing (Subscriptions)
For publications, services, and other recurring charges:
- **Individual paid-through evaluation**: Each subscription tracked independently
- **Optional product handling**: Include/exclude specific products
- **Separate from membership**: Can have different cycle than dues

### Billing Cycle Tools
List billing cycles:
```
imis_entity_list LegacyBillingCycle limit=50
```

List billing items:
```
imis_entity_list LegacyBillingItem limit=100
```

### AutoPay Configuration
- **All contacts**: Process everyone with stored payment method
- **AutoPay-only**: Only contacts who opted into AutoPay
- **Non-AutoPay only**: Generate invoices for manual payers
- **Accounting method**: Cash or Accrual basis

Check AutoPay status:
```
imis_autopay_summary partyId={id}
```

Review gateway accounts:
```
imis_gateway_accounts partyId={id}
```

### Configuration Guidance
- **Cash vs Accrual**: Accrual recognises revenue when invoiced; Cash when paid. Choose based on accounting standards
- **Grace period design**: Typical: 30 days (standard), 60 days (lenient), 90 days (very lenient). Grace period = time after expiry before member loses access
- **Renewal reminders**: Set up 60-day, 30-day, and 7-day reminder emails before expiry
- **Billing run schedule**: Test in staging first — billing generates real invoices

---

## Pricing Configuration

### Pricing Groups
Control who can purchase products and at what price:
- Pricing groups are sets of contacts eligible for specific pricing
- A contact can belong to multiple pricing groups
- Products can have different prices for different groups

### Event Pricing
- **Multi-tier pricing**: Early bird, standard, late registration
- **Member vs non-member**: Different rates by membership status
- **Registration options**: Individual functions/sessions priced separately
- **Staff override**: Allow staff to override pricing for special circumstances

### Product Pricing Tools
List item prices:
```
imis_entity_list ItemPrice limit=100
```

List price sheet prices:
```
imis_entity_list PriceSheetProductPrice limit=100
```

### Special Pricing (Expression Builder)
For complex dues pricing based on member attributes:
- Revenue tier pricing (based on organisation revenue)
- Sliding scale (based on number of employees)
- Regional variations
- Uses Expression Builder BOs — calculated at billing time

### Guidance
- **Test pricing thoroughly**: Create test contacts in each pricing group and verify correct amounts
- **Document pricing logic**: Keep a spreadsheet mapping member types to pricing tiers
- **Effective dates**: Use price sheets for time-bound pricing (early bird deadlines)
- **Discount structures**: Use promotion codes for one-off discounts rather than creating price exceptions

## Commerce / Online Store Setup

### Product Types
- **Physical products**: Shipped goods — requires shipping configuration
- **Digital products**: PDF, video, audio, web content — delivered electronically
- **Subscriptions**: Recurring charges — tied to billing cycles
- **Events**: Event registrations (handled via Event module)
- **Donations**: Gift/giving products (handled via Fundraising module)

### Shopping Cart Configuration
- Cart timeout settings
- Guest checkout vs member-only
- Required fields at checkout
- Confirmation email templates

### Tax Configuration
- **US**: State and local sales tax rates
- **Canada**: HST, GST, PST by province
- **EU**: VAT rates by country
- **Australia/NZ**: GST flat rate
- Tax-exempt products and customer types

### Promotion Codes
- **General**: Apply to any product in cart
- **Product-specific**: Only for designated items
- **Time-limited**: Start and end dates
- **Usage limits**: Max uses per code or per customer

### Commerce Tools
List products:
```
imis_entity_list Item limit=100
```

Create an order:
```
imis_create_order partyId={id} items='[{"ItemId":"PROD001","Quantity":1}]'
```

Check lookup tables (for product categories, order types):
```
imis_lookup_tables tableName={name}
```

### Guidance
- **Payment gateway**: Must be configured before accepting online payments. Common: Authorize.Net, PayPal, Stripe (via integration)
- **Order confirmation emails**: Configure templates in Communications > Email Templates
- **Shipping zones**: Define zones and rates in Commerce > Shipping before selling physical products
- **Test orders**: Always place test orders through the full checkout flow before going live

## Process Automation

### Scheduled Tasks
Automated jobs that run on a schedule or trigger:
- **Email tasks**: Send templated emails to a query-defined audience
- **Report-attached email**: Generate and email report PDFs
- **Stored procedure tasks**: Execute custom SQL procedures
- **Premium tasks** (requires license): Custom business logic, webhooks, external integrations

### Task Triggers
- **Manual**: Run on-demand from the task manager
- **Scheduled**: Cron-like scheduling (daily, weekly, monthly, specific time)
- **Webhook**: Triggered by external HTTP call
- **Database change**: Fires on insert, update, or delete of specific records

### Standard Alerts (Out-of-the-Box)
iMIS includes 30+ pre-built alerts:
- **Event**: Registration confirmation, cancellation, waitlist promotion
- **Membership**: Welcome new member, renewal reminder, lapse notification
- **Commerce**: Order confirmation, shipping notification
- **Fundraising**: Gift acknowledgment, pledge reminder
- **System**: Failed login, data import complete

### Process Automation Tools
View task execution history:
```
imis_task_log action="list" limit=20
```

List configured notifications:
```
imis_notifications action="list"
```

Get notification details:
```
imis_notifications action="get" id={notificationId}
```

### Guidance
- **Start with standard alerts**: Customise the 30+ built-in alerts before creating new ones
- **Test in staging**: Automated tasks generate real emails and data changes — always test first
- **Scheduling best practice**: Schedule heavy tasks during off-peak hours
- **Communication templates**: Design email templates in Communications before linking to tasks
- **Error monitoring**: Check `imis_task_log` regularly for failed task executions
- **Note**: Creating new custom tasks requires the iMIS Premium license. Basic task configuration is available in all editions

## Form Builder

### Form Capabilities
iMIS forms integrate natively with the database:
- Combine data from multiple sources (contact fields, panel sources, addresses)
- Enforce business rules (required fields, validation, conditional logic)
- Post-submission workflows (email, activity logging, group assignment)
- Responsive design for mobile

### Form Elements
- **Contact fields**: Name, email, phone, address (mapped to Party entity)
- **Address block**: Full address with country-specific formatting
- **Activity logging**: Auto-create activity records on submission
- **Document upload**: File attachment fields
- **Custom panel fields**: Fields from any Panel Source
- **HTML content**: Static text, instructions, section headers

### Post-Submission Actions
- **Button automation**: Trigger workflows on form submit
- **Email notification**: Send confirmation to submitter and/or staff
- **Conditional logic**: Show/hide fields based on other field values
- **Group assignment**: Auto-add contact to group on submit
- **Activity creation**: Log form submission as contact activity

### Form Tools
List existing forms:
```
imis_forms action="list"
```

View form responses:
```
imis_form_responses formId={id} limit=50
```

### Form Health Checks
iMIS runs automatic health checks every 24 hours:
- **Missing dropdowns**: Value list references that no longer exist
- **Field size mismatches**: Form field length vs database column length
- **Type changes**: Data type changes that affect existing form fields
- Review health in: Settings > Forms > Health Check

### Guidance
- **Duplicate checking**: Configure duplicate-check logic to prevent creating duplicate contacts on public forms
- **Styling**: Forms inherit site theme CSS — use custom CSS classes for specific form styling
- **Testing**: Test every form as both a logged-in member and an anonymous visitor
- **CAPTCHA**: Enable on public-facing forms to prevent spam submissions
- **Confirmation page**: Always configure a meaningful confirmation/thank-you page

## Data Migration (iImport)

### Overview
iImport is the built-in data import tool for bulk data loading:
- **Format**: Excel `.xlsx` files only
- **Max records**: 250,000 per file (recommended max: 10,000 for reliability)
- **Actions**: Insert (new records only), Update (existing only), Insert/Update (both)
- **Templates**: Reusable import templates for recurring imports

### Import Process
1. **Plan**: Map source system fields to iMIS entity fields
2. **Prepare**: Clean data in Excel — standardise formats, remove duplicates
3. **Template**: Create or select an import template mapping columns to fields
4. **Upload**: Upload Excel file and select template
5. **Preview**: Review mapping and sample records before executing
6. **Execute**: Run the import — monitor progress
7. **Verify**: Check results for errors and successful records

### Import Tools
List available import file types (templates):
```
imis_import_file_types
```

Execute an import batch:
```
imis_import_batch filePath={path} fileType={templateName} action="insert"
```

### Data Preparation Guidelines
- **Date format**: Use `YYYY-MM-DD` for international compatibility
- **Required fields**: Ensure all required fields have values (Party: LastName, MemberType at minimum)
- **Unique identifiers**: Include Party ID for updates, or use email/name matching for insert/update
- **Character encoding**: UTF-8 for international characters
- **Lookup values**: Verify all code values exist in lookup tables before import (member types, prefixes, etc.)

### Common Import Scenarios
- **Contact migration**: Names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, demographics
- **Membership history**: Subscription records with join dates, expiry dates, member types
- **Giving history**: Gift records with amounts, dates, campaign codes, fund codes
- **Event history**: Past event registrations and attendance
- **Custom data**: Panel source data for custom fields

### Guidance
- **Always back up first**: Export existing data before running large imports
- **Test with small batch**: Import 10-50 records first, verify, then run full import
- **Deduplication**: Run duplicate checking before import — iMIS has built-in duplicate detection
- **Scheduling**: Schedule large imports during off-peak hours — imports can lock tables
- **Error handling**: Download the error report after each import — fix and re-import failed records
- **Recurring imports**: Save templates for regular data loads (monthly chapter reports, quarterly giving, etc.)

## SSO & Integrations

### Single Sign-On (SSO)
iMIS supports industry-standard SSO protocols:
- **SAML 2.0**: Enterprise SSO standard — works with most identity providers
- **OpenID Connect (OAuth 2.0)**: Modern web standard — used by social logins and cloud providers

### Supported Identity Providers
- **Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure AD): Most common for Microsoft-based organisations
- **Custom SAML providers**: Any SAML 2.0-compliant IdP
- **Social logins**: Can be configured via OpenID Connect

### SSO Configuration (Advisory)
SSO setup is done through the iMIS admin UI — not via API:
1. **Choose protocol**: SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect based on your IdP
2. **Configure IdP**: Set up iMIS as a service provider in your identity provider
3. **Exchange metadata**: Share IdP metadata URL with iMIS, iMIS SP metadata with IdP
4. **Map user attributes**: Map IdP user profile fields to iMIS Party fields
5. **Test**: Verify login flow with a test account before rolling out
6. **TLS requirement**: TLS 1.2 or higher required for all SSO connections

### Integration Ecosystem
iMIS integrates with:
- **Cvent**: Event management sync (registrations, attendees)
- **Microsoft Outlook**: Calendar and contact sync
- **Zendesk**: Support ticket integration
- **GL Processor Cloud**: General ledger accounting sync
- **Custom integrations**: Via REST API (this agent plugin) or webhooks

### Guidance
- **No software installation**: iMIS SSO is cloud-configured — no on-premise software needed
- **User provisioning**: Decide between JIT (just-in-time) provisioning and pre-provisioned accounts
- **Fallback**: Always maintain a local admin account that doesn't use SSO (for emergency access)
- **Testing**: Test SSO with multiple browsers and devices before enabling for all users
- **Documentation**: Record all IdP configuration settings — SSO issues are hard to debug without configuration details
